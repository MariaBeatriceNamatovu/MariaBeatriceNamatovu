### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Maria Beatrice.
I'm a junior software engineer, data analyst, and UI designer passionate about AI and Cybersecurity. I enjoy building user-intuitive interfaces that deliver high-end user experiences and are fun. 
Some technologies I love working with are Javascript, Python, and CSS. I am currently working as an OpenSource contributor with GirlScript Summer of Code to build real-world projects and create an impact in the world of technology.
